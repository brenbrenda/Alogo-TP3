Strategy Pattern
using SOLID to implement the same function even they have different usage but the same interfaces to modify easily and have a cleaner pattern.



Oberver Pattern
-an Publisher as an Interface to notify the update, 
-an Oberserver to observe the message changes,
-an MessagePublisher uses the Publisher override the function thus the observer will change at the point


ex: Notification, Music in iOS
